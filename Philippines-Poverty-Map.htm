  <h1>Choropleth Map of Poverty in the Philippines</h1>

 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><font size="4"><i>"The Philippines is rich but the people are poor."</i></font></p>
<p><font size="4">That quote is a devastating reality for the vast amjority of the over 100 million people that call that the archipelago home. Despite its natural beauty and abundance of valued resources such as agriculture,
most Filipinos struggle to put food on their tables or earn a living wage. In fact, the discrepancy between regional minimum wages and family living wages will be part of this geospatial analysis of poverty in the Philippines.
The project will show that while the people in the Philippines are generally poor, poverty is not equal across the country, being concentrated in certain geographic locations.</font></p>

<div id="METHODOLOGY" align="left">
 <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<p><font size="4">Using ArcGIS Pro, I will create a choropleth map of the Philippines (by region) that maps the difference between their mimimum wages and family living wages (or "wage gap"first calculated by IBON Foudnation, 
then converted from Philippine Pesos, PHP, to Canadian Dollars, CAD). This was done by first downloading the appropriate shapefile, then creating and downloading a csv of the wage gap data, before performing a merge on both datasets.
I will also digitize 5 red points that map the 5 highly urbanized cities with the highest poverty rate (poverty incidence among famillies-%), as well as two dashed laine that demarcate the three main island groups (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao).
A legend, scale, and compass were added both for informational purposes and to reduce whitespace.</font></p>

 <h2>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>
<img src="https://coursera-assessments.s3.amazonaws.com/assessments/1731125207555/7ab6ee9d-85e4-4195-bb4c-e9a9e59fc9d1/Brief%20Snapshot%20of%20Filipino%20Community%20in%20Toronto.jpeg" 
alt="Stellite basemap image of Toronto. The following three map elements have been layerd on top of it: (1) 5 digitized shapes representing the 5 aforementioned ridings, each with different shades
of blue to represent different per-capita Filipino populations (2) 10 digitized red lines representing the 10 busiest bus routes in Toronto (3) Several heart inside white circle icons scattered
across the map representing Toronto's hospital, with a higher density of them in downtown Toronto." width="900" height="1400"/>

<p><font size="2"> <i> <b>IMAGE DESCRIPTION:</b>Choropleth map of the Philippines covering poverty-related data, showing wage gap by regions, red points that represent the most impoverished cities, and dashed lines demarcating the three main island groups. 
    With regards to the map design, even though the compass symbol and scale were not important in the context of this analysis, they were nevertheless resized and repositioned in a way that reduced whitespace as much as possible. Despite not being of the same administrative levels as provinces, regions, countries, etc., their font sizes were nevertheless resized as such 
    to make their geographic location on the map more prominent (as they are important to the analysis). The choropleth colour scheme involved different tones of just one colour, as the region-by-region analysis only focused on one factor (wage gap).</font></i></p>

<p><font size="4"> Notice that they are concentrated in Toronto's northern suburb (North York) and eastern suburb (Scarborough). Observe that 7 of the 10 busiest routes traverse the highlighted ridings, and two
more straddling one or more of their borders. Also observe that the hospitals are more concentrated in the downtown while they become more sparse in the suburbs, especially in Scarborough, despite the fact that well over half a million people live in Scarborough.
</p>

<p><font size="4">Based on the choropleth map, it appears that poverty is highly concentrated in the southern region of Mindanao, especially in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (very dark shade of blue). It is also interesting to note that 3 of the top 5 most impoverished cities are based in Mindanao. Of course, they are a multitude of ways to measure poverty, 
    and this map is an oversimplification that does not account for differences within each regions, provinces, and island groups. Rigorous socioeconomic-based analysis such as exploring how poverty disproportionately impacts people from the peasant and urban poor classes, LGBTQ+ communities, Indigenous ethnic groups such as the Moro and Igorot peoples, and so forth, will have to compliment spatial analysis work like this one. 
    Nevertheless, this is a good start, as the data is relatively recent and came from reliable and authoritative sources. </p>
