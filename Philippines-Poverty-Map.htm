  <h1>Choropleth Map of Poverty in the Philippines</h1>

 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><font size="4">For my project, I am focusing on Toronto, the city that I have lived in for over 20 years. Not only is the diversity of the city makes it an interesting case study for 
spatial analysis, but my familiarity with its human and physical geography makes it an easy choice for my very first GIS project. Being a Filipino immigrant myself, 
I wanted to observe and analyze a brief snapshot of the five federal Toronto ridings (2013 representation order) that have the highest per-capita Filipino population 
based on the 2021 Census, and map out its relationships with hospital locations and transit lines.By doing so, I hope to map out and analyze any potential patterns that 
can utilized when discussing transit accessibility and health inequalities affecting the cityâ€™s Filipino community.</p>
</div>

<div id="METHODOLOGY" align="left">
 <h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<p><font size="4">Using ArcGIS Pro, I will map the said five federal ridings by digitizing polygons on a satellite basemap of Toronto. I will also digitize 10 red lines that roughly map the 
Toronto Transit Commission's 10 busiest bus routes from 2023 based on ridership, as well as several points (each represented by a health symbol) that map out the locations of hospitals 
officially under "Ontario Health Toronto".</font></p>

 <h2>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</h2>

alt="Stellite basemap image of Toronto. The following three map elements have been layerd on top of it: (1) 5 digitized shapes representing the 5 aforementioned ridings, each with different shades
of blue to represent different per-capita Filipino populations (2) 10 digitized red lines representing the 10 busiest bus routes in Toronto (3) Several heart inside white circle icons scattered
across the map representing Toronto's hospital, with a higher density of them in downtown Toronto." width="900" height="1400"/>

<p><font size="2"> <i> <b>IMAGE DESCRIPTION:</b>Choropleth map of the Philippines covering poverty-related data, showing wage gap by regions, red points that represent the most impoverished cities, and dashed lines demarcating the three main island groups. 
    With regards to the map design, even though the compass symbol and scale were not important in the context of this analysis, they were nevertheless resized and repositioned in a way that reduced whitespace as much as possible. Despite not being of the same administrative levels as provinces, regions, countries, etc., their font sizes were nevertheless resized as such 
    to make their geographic location on the map more prominent (as they are important to the analysis). The choropleth colour scheme involved different tones of just one colour, as the region-by-region analysis only focused on one factor (wage gap).</font></i></p>

<p><font size="4"> Notice that they are concentrated in Toronto's northern suburb (North York) and eastern suburb (Scarborough). Observe that 7 of the 10 busiest routes traverse the highlighted ridings, and two
more straddling one or more of their borders. Also observe that the hospitals are more concentrated in the downtown while they become more sparse in the suburbs, especially in Scarborough, despite the fact that well over half a million people live in Scarborough.
</p>

<p><font size="4">Based on the choropleth map, it appears that poverty is highly concentrated in the southern region of Mindanao, especially in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (very dark shade of blue). It is also interesting to note that 3 of the top 5 most impoverished cities are based in Mindanao. Of course, they are a multitude of ways to measure poverty, 
    and this map is an oversimplification that does not account for differences within each regions, provinces, and island groups. Rigorous socioeconomic-based analysis such as exploring how poverty disproportionately impacts people from the peasant and urban poor classes, LGBTQ+ communities, Indigenous ethnic groups such as the Moro and Igorot peoples, and so forth, will have to compliment spatial analysis work like this one. 
    Nevertheless, this is a good start, as the data is relatively recent and came from reliable and authoritative sources. </p>
